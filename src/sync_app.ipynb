    "\n",
    "- Logging could be improved by using a logger object and be appropriatly handled by it since python has a built-in library for that.\n",

    "- The code could be improved by using a class to handle the syncronization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing: While I have tested the code enough to check that it works as expected, I haven't used any testing library to do so due to time constraints.\n",

    "\n",
    "- While as implementing I have noticed ways to optimize the code, I have decided to leave it as it is to show my thought process and how I have improved the code as I was implementing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This version should be considered as **working as required**, but not as a **final version** which, given more time, I could put more thought in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have decided to use the ``os`` library to handle the file system operations which have most of the time been used in other projects I have done before and were enough for the job, but I have noticed that there is a library called ``shutil`` which could be used to handle the file system operations in a more efficient way. I have decided to not use it because a version **from scratch** could help me deliver a version as fast as possible due to more familiarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I haven't used any third-party library to handle the MD5 hash, but I have used the built-in library ``hashlib`` to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I have chosen the Jupyter Notebook to write the code because it is a tool I am familiar which makes it easeir for me to use, showcase and illustrate my thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- I am aware that I could make everything using just linux commands like ``rsync`` or ``dd`` if it were the case and automate the process using cron, but I am more confortable with python code since despite being familiar with most basic-intermidiate unix commands.\n",
    "\n",

    "- [How To Detect File Changes with Python (and send notification)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVDajXJEpmg) - is totally different from what I have implemented but it helped me as a first concept.\n",
